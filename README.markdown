# CDB Demo

This application is a demo to integrate data from CDB with the Cesium.js 3D library.

## Development Environment

The app is JavaScript and builds using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). To start, install the base Node packages:

    $ npm install

Now you can start the local development server:

    $ node preview.js

That's all. The server is now running at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
